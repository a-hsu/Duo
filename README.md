# Duo

Duo is a mobile social app that allows users to assign themselves to requests from other users. If you need an extra person for a pickup game, or a gym buddy to keep you accountable, or even just someone to keep you company while you walk your dog, Duo will assign you a user based on your needs. This project was created during a hackathon and is still in development.

Technologies used: React Native, GraphQL, Apollo Client/Server, Express, MongoDB

Note: Currently, the backend is in development, but here is a video to a small demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8-CHJf_d78
